# Introduction

The goal of the project is to create a map representing the different migration flux of each countries, with colours ranging from red (high emigration), yellow (balanced migration) to green (high immigration). A colorblind is also available. The data spans the period 1990 to 2015.

Clicking on a country will show the country where most people emigrated to, and the country where people immigrated the most from.
